Artscript is, in essence, a small app (or big script) to easy convert production file images (KRA, XCF, PSD, ORA, SVG, PNG) to universal formats (JPG, PNG, GIF or WEBM).

In between the production file and the final image you can decide many aspects of the final image. The final image can be of any size, or multiple, have a watermark placed, image or text, or a collection or images can be ensemble together to form a tiled image file (For more details read "How to use it" section below).

The original idea, developed by by David Revoy (www.davidrevoy.com , info@davidrevoy.com), was about a small script to run from the file manager (dolphin, thunar nautilus) to quickly deploy the desired images. It can still be used like that, and some other ways are possible now.

It can be used in the following ways
* From the right click menu of your file manager (recommended)
* From terminal. while it doesn't accept input from redirectio you can feed the script using "xargs"
* Standalone: the script can be launched as an application on it's own. adding files using the buttons or dragging and dropping files into the app window.

Made with digital designers and painters in mind, the final images aim for high quality results, not speed. However the script remembers the last used settings to fasten deployment of several images made for a project at different moments in the preproduction stage.

When working on several proyects a presets.config is available to set more than one preset, so you can have a "personal" preset, with sizes tailored for your blog and a "Client work" with your personal information as a watermark label a proper size, or sizes, for the client needs.
